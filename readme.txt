What Is This?

This mod adds a hotkey for making a car horn sound.

When you are in the driver's seat press "H" by default to press the car horn (you can rebind the key in your DayZ settings).

The mod is very simple. When you press the horn one of 3 random horn sounds will play, and there are two sets of sounds: one for cars and one for trucks.

I haven't tested it on Expansion, but it works fine on most car mods. It will probably also work in helicopters so if you don't want that you might need to edit the source code to remove them.

I don't have time to do this for you but any experienced modder will be able to, and I give full permission to modify the source code however you like and repack the mod.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
